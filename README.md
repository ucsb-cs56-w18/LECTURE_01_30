# LECTURE_01_30

Please get a copy of [IC01](https://ucsb-cs56-w18.github.io/hwk/ic01/) and [IC01 Handout A](https://ucsb-cs56-w18.github.io/hwk/ic01/handout_a/) and start working on the problems.

Feel free to discuss with other students.  

If you get finished, find someone else near you that is finished, and compare answers.

We'll work though all the problems.  There are some extra copies in case you find that you've 
spoiled yours with wrong answers and want to start over.   This is basically a participation grade, because
we are going to go over the problems together before class is over, and you'll have a chance to correct
any wrong answers.  This is practice for the first midterm, the date of which is on the [Calendar](https://ucsb-cs56-w18.github.io/info/calendar/) 
now.
